    * 	 To allow scores to be kept so the user knows how many times it won.


### 2. Scope
 * I wanted a simple, straightforward UX experience.
 * As the game is based on running javascript i wanted the ux to be easy and clear desgin

### 3. Structure
*	A clear layout is in place to ensure users can immediately find all the information with a header telling the user to select a card
*   Once a user selects a card there card and the result and the computers card will appear.
*   A score box will also appear to allow the user to keep score.

### 4. Skeleton
This is the wireframe i created of the project.
A simple version of the game that allows the user to select a card and the computer will pick a card and the result will be shown of the user.

 # Known Bugs

## User card not selected bug.

* I have found while testing there is a bug that happens sometimes where when the user selects there card there is no card selected but if you press the card or another card the program wil work as intended.
* There doesnt seem to be any pattern to the bug as when it happens it can be any card seletion or any computer selection. 
* Screenshots shown as below from what the user sees and what the console sees.
